# FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the **FeatureForge** project, focused on mastering **Requirement Analysis** within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
The case study centers on a **Property Booking Management System**, simulating real-world requirement documentation and analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the role of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC.
- Translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Differentiate between **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Create **use case diagrams** to visualize system interactions.
- Define **acceptance criteria** aligned with stakeholder expectations.
- Apply industry-standard documentation practices.

---

## 📝 Deliverables
1. **Project Definition**
   - Clear explanation of Requirement Analysis and its importance.
2. **Requirement Documentation**
   - Functional vs. Non-functional requirements with examples.
   - Detailed requirement specifications and use cases.
3. **Use Case Diagram**
   - Visual representation of actors and system interactions.
   - Exported as `alx-booking-uc.png`.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Example criteria for key features (e.g., checkout process).
5. **Supporting Files**
   - `README.md` (this document).
   - Additional diagrams or notes as needed.
